\section{Matrix Addition}
Matrix addition is completed element wise. To calculate an element in matrix C, the corresponding elements in both matrix A and matrix B are added. Two dimentional and three dimentional addition are accomplished in the same manner.
\begin{equation}
	c_{ij} = a_{ij}+b_{ij}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	c_{ijk} = a_{ijk}+b_{ijk}
\end{equation}
This was accomplished by using nested \verb|for| loops. While this method is inefficient, it is simple and is easily parallelisable.
