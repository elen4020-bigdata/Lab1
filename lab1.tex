\section{3-D Array Multiplication}

To obtain each element in matrix $C$, matrix $A$ and $B$ are divided into two dimensional matrices, $A'$ and $B'$ as can be seen in figure \ref{3DMult}.
For each two dimensional matrix, a single row and column is multiplied to get the corresonding element in the $C$ matrix.
This leads to a single value which is the element in the $C$ matrix.
This is done for all elements in the $C$ matrix.

\end{figure}

Two \texttt{for} loops were used to maintain the row and column of the current element in matrix $C$.
Another \texttt{for} loop was used to traverse the depth of the matrix $C$.
The row $a$ and column $b$ were then obtained from matrices $A$ and $B$ as seen in figure \ref{3DMult}.
Vector multiplication was then used on vectors $a$ and $b$.
The resulting value is the corresponding element of $C$.

This was repeated for all elements in matrix $C$.
It was assumed matrix $A$ and $B$ are cubes.
