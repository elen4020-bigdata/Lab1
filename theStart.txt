/section{Two dimensional matrix multiplication}

The resultant matrix C is found after multiplying matrix A and B.
For each element in C, the corresponding row in A is multiplied by the corresponding column in B.





/section{Three dimensional matrix multiplication}

*probably need a picture*
To obtain each element in matrix C, matrix A and B are divided into two dimensional matrices.
For each two dimensional matrix, a single row and column is multiplied to get the corresonding element in the C matrix.
This is done for all elements in the c matrix.
