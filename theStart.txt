
Matrix C is the result of multiplying matrix A and B.
In two dimensions, both A and B are square matrices of equal size, N.
In three dimensions, both A and B are cubic matrices of equl size, N.
The matrices A and B are populated with random values that range 0 - 20.
N is set to 10 and 20.

/section{Two dimensional matrix multiplication}

The resultant matrix C is found after multiplying matrix A and B.
For each element in C, the corresponding row in A is multiplied by the corresponding column in B.


c_{i,j} = /Sigma a_{i,k} /times b_{k,j}


/section{Three dimensional matrix multiplication}

*probably need a picture*
To obtain each element in matrix C, matrix A and B are divided into two dimensional matrices.
For each two dimensional matrix, a single row and column is multiplied to get the corresonding element in the C matrix.
This leads to a single value which is the element in the C matrix.
This is done for all elements in the c matrix.
